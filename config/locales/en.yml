      Borosilicate glass which will not absorb odors or chemical residues. CHEMEX

    columb_amaca_desc: AMACA stands for Asociación de Mujeres Productoras Agropecuarias
      del Cauca, a group of 80 women’ producers who are based in El Tambo, Cauca,
      Colombia since 1999. This association has registered a steady growth and, today,
      it counts up to 140 women from three different villages in the same region.
      All of these women own the land they farm and are the heads of their households.
      The average farm size is one hectare per member, with many even smaller. Most
      members harvest only fully ripe cherries which are de-pulped on the same day
      of harvest and are then processed on their farms. Drying is done on raised beds
      inside parabolic dryers.
    columb_fudam_desc: 'FUDAM stands for Fundación Agraria y Ambiental Para el Desarrollo
      Sostentible - a 300 member’s association of organic and Rainforest Alliance
      certified coffee growers founded in the year 2000. This group of smallholders
      lives in and around the municipality of La Unión in Nariño. Villages are at
      such high altitude that the growing areas, instead of being in higher grounds,
      lay bellow, surrounded by beautiful high peaks and rough roads. Today, FUDAM''s
      growers still firmly believe in the principles of sustainability, the ideal
      that brought them together. Recently, when asked why they continue to farm organically,
      despite the pressure to rely on chemical inputs, the association explained:
      ''This is just how we live; these are our values and our way of life.'''
    ethiopia_desc: Tega & Tula speciality Coffee Farm located at Keffa province bio-reserve,
      takes its name after the two nearby villages in Woreda, Gibo district, Keffa,
      Ethiopia. The farm spreads out through 500 hectares where 400 hectares are planted
      with different coffee varieties. Ethiopian varieties, cultivars from the 70s
      as well as wild coffee from the Keffa forest, together all contribute for the
      uniqueness of the coffee grown here. Coffee harvest and de-pulping always takes
      place on the same day. The coffee beans are then fermented underwater for 36
      hours. Is this anaerobic fermentation that enhances the flavors and aromas of
      each and every bean. It is then washed in local canals and thereafter, spends
      between 16 and18 hours soaking in a tank before being spread on the drying tables.
      It takes washed coffee beans between 7 to 11 days to dry out.

    nica_desc: Cerro de Jesus or Jesus Mountain Farm is located in Jalapa, Neuva Segovia,
      on the second highest peak of Nicaragua. The farm spreads through 700 hectares
      of which about 400 hectares are a beautiful forest reserve. In 2017, Jesus Mountain
      Farm decided to partner with Cafetos de Segovia, a small specialty mill and
      export company run by two sisters Martha and Ana Albir. The Albir sisters inherited
      from their father the passion and knowledge to grow their own coffee. Later
      they acquired a mill and by 2016 they were providing milling and export services
      to neighboring small coffee farms. This new venture allowed them to contact
      directly with farms with socially conscious practices and they were also able
      to focus in separating of coffee by variety.

    about:
      about_text_1_html: "<strong>Brava</strong> is a micro coffee roaster based in
        Lisbon, founded in 2018 by Joana and Susana out of the desire to find “the
        perfect cup of coffee”. Following strict principles in the choice of beans,
        bringing together the best coffees and transforming the characteristics of
        the grain into unique sensations for the palate, through a careful roasting
        process."
      about_text_2_html: For over 20 years, Joana and Susana, have been involved in
        the world of restaurants and bars in Lisbon, always looking for the balance
        between the multiple inspirations they have been collecting on various trips
        and the experiences the city can offer. On their trips they confirmed that
        coffee is much more than just a drink. Going to drink a coffee has also means
        an encounter. Coffee gathers people around, it’s a pretext for sharing and
        creating bonds. Drinking a specialty coffee takes this experience to a higher
        level, a coffee of excellence tells a story of community, culture, dedication,
        involvement and passion.
      about_text_quote: We believe that coffee is not a product, but an entire experience.

      chemex: CHEMEX
      chemex_html: "<li>Fold the CHEMEX® coffee filter, make sure the three thickness
        of the filter are across the vent.</li> <br> <li>Coffee ratio should be 19
        grams per 250ml, into the filter cone (one teaspoon is approximately 5 grams
        of coffee).</li> <br> <li>Moisten the filter with warm water to rinse and
        preheat the coffee maker; as soon as the water is completely drained by the
        filter, pour it from the coffee maker keeping the filter sealed against the
        wall of the coffee maker.</li> <br> <li>Pour a small amount of water over
        the grinded coffee (just enough to wet the surface of the coffee, without
        floating them, as this pre-wetting allows coffee to “bloom,” and prepare for
        an even infusion) and wait 30 seconds.</li> <br> <li>Pour the rest of the
        water slowly in a circular motion into the coffee, but keep the water level
        well below the top of the coffee maker.</li> <br> <li>Once the desired amount
        of coffee is brewed, lift the filter with spent grounds out of the brewer
        and discard.</li> <br> <li>Serve and enjoy! </li>"
      fp_1: Grind the coffee beans coarsely (think of breadcrumbs) and for each 300gr
        of water use 22 gr of coffee.
      fp_2: Heat the coffee maker with hot water, gradually so as not to break the
        glass (the infusion temperature drops quickly if the French press is cold
        and prevents the coffee from getting lukewarm at the end).
      fp_3: Remove the hot water and add the ground coffee.
      fp_4: Heat the water to around 96º C. Pour the water and stir a few times.
      fp_5: Close the lid and press the plunger down to the water level. Leave to
        infuse for 4 minutes.
      fp_6: After those 4 minutes, push slowly the plunger all the way.
      fp_7: Enjoy your coffee!

      intro_brewing_html: There is no correct way to prepare a cup of coffee. <br>
        There are so many variables at play when making a great cup of coffee - water,
        grind, equipment.. - <br> This is just a suggestion for a starting point.
        <br><strong>Feel free to play with the weights and preparation times to get
        the perfect cup!</strong>
