# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'

  # about us
    about:
      about_text_1_html: "<strong>Brava</strong> is a micro coffee roaster based in Lisbon, founded in 2018 by Joana and Susana out of the desire to find “the perfect cup of coffee”. Following strict principles in the choice of beans, bringing together the best coffees and transforming the characteristics of the grain into unique sensations for the palate, through a careful roasting process."
      about_text_quote: "We believe that coffee is not a product, but an entire experience."
      about_text_2_html: "For over 20 years, Joana and Susana, have been involved in the world of restaurants and bars in Lisbon, always looking for the balance between the multiple inspirations they have been collecting on various trips and the experiences the city can offer. On their trips they confirmed that coffee is much more than just a drink. Going to drink a coffee has also means an encounter. Coffee gathers people around, it’s a pretext for sharing and creating
            bonds. Drinking a specialty coffee takes this experience to a higher level, a coffee of excellence tells a story of community, culture, dedication, involvement and passion."
